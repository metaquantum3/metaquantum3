We are a young Romanian team who aim to develop a time-saving marketplace into the metaverse together with a phone application that allows its users to scan objects like proprieties, cars, phones, etc. Bringing them into the metaverse marketplace, our main goal is to drastically reduce the time needed to make a decision, so the users will have access to a premium marketplace, where they will be able to visualize and interact with the goods they are willing to purchase with the comfort from their own home.
